### Description

This ActiveX control uses BitBlt to draw a reel, or reels in a PictureBox and then spin/nudge them. It is quite quick (no Timers !!). Properties include: Reels, PicsPerReel, SpinDirection, NaturalFinish, EnableHold, Etc. It has useful subs/functions like Spin, Nudge, IsHeld, ReelPos, StopSpinning, Etc. Also includes OnReelStart, OnReelStop, OnEachFullCycle, and OnReelClick events. As it uses BitBlt I've included a handy Masker/Spriter program but it's not mine !! Please comment, feedback is much appreciated, but go easy on me - it's my first control!! Full source and an example project included. Enjoy! (Oh yeah - full instructions if you have problems figuring anything out in the ReadMe.doc)
 
### More Info
 
You will need to compile the .ctl file into a .ocx file before using the example project.
